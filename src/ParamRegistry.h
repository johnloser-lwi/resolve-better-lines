// Every parameter this plugin defines, recorded as it is defined.
//
// The alternative -- what resolve-multi-transform does -- is a struct mirroring
// each parameter by hand, written out three times: once in the struct, once in
// the serialiser, once in the parser. That is 370 lines there for ~100
// parameters, and this plugin has well over 200. Worse, every new parameter has
// to be added in all three places, and forgetting one produces a preset that
// silently does not save that setting: a bug with no symptom until someone
// reloads a preset and quietly loses their work.
//
// Registering name and type at the point of definition means the preset system
// covers every parameter automatically, including ones added later, and there is
// exactly one list which cannot fall out of step with itself.
